    <h3>Provinsion of education to young learners</h3>
    <p>What is the importance of education?
Image result for provision of education <img src="img/education.JPEG%20Image.jpg" height="600"width="1000"></a>
Educating children not only secures their personal life but collectively contributes to the development of a more reliable
      nation and the world. It can yield a better surrounding in which people can differentiate between right and wrong,
      know the importance of voting, adhere to laws, and reduce crimes.</p>
    <h3>Crisis Avoidance</h3>
    <p>A timely and precise response to each critical event is essential to minimize the impact of the crisis. A CM plan
      must prevent delays, missed tasks and assignments, or laggy crisis response times. Even if crises aren’t all digital,
      “digital-first” is the best way to approach developing a crisis management plan. For example, if the organization has
      only one physical campus, an on-premises solution could prove a pitfall if the operations center were to become inaccessible.
    When building a CM plan, an organization must facilitate communications and coordination that are clear and quick,
      relying on CM technology that ensures the safety of people, the protection of assets, and the effective recovery of
      business as usual. <img src="img/Crisis-Management-blog.JPEG Image.jpg"height="600" width="1000"/></a>
    Successful CM plans address five essential topics: people, facilities/critical infrastructure, technology, business, and brand reputation.
    People: People are every organization’s most important asset, and enterprises have a duty of care to their employees.
      Ensure that in every
      critical event, the crisis team can answer whether lives are in danger, if there is a physical safety issue, and
      whether there will be
      impact on employees, customers, visitors, and vendors. How will they be notified with emergency notifications?
    Facilities/Critical Infrastructure: Facilities and critical infrastructure must be checked to ascertain whether they
      have been impacted by the event or are at risk of harm in the event of a crisis that plays out over time.
    Technology: A crisis management plan must cover technology as well.  Ask yourself: is there a service disruption, an
      information security issue, or risk of either? Who is on point for addressing potential or actual failures in technical
      infrastructure during a critical event?

Business: In a crisis, business processes and activities need to be included in the CM plan. Can the organization still
      perform mission-critical business processes? Is this crisis affecting customers or having a significant financial impact on the company?<img

    <h3>Women Empowerment</h3>
    <p>Women’s empowerment can be defined to promoting women’s sense of self-worth, their ability to determine their own
      choices, and their right to influence social change for themselves and others.
It is closely aligned with female empowerment – a fundamental human right that’s also key to achieving a more peaceful,
      prosperous world. src="img/wempowerment.JPEG Image jpg" height="600" width="1000"/></p>
In Western countries, female empowerment is often associated with specific phases of the women’s rights movement in history.
      This movement tends to be split into three waves, the first beginning in the 19th and early 20th century where
      suffrage was a key feature. The second wave of the 1960s included the sexual revolution and the role of women in society.
      Third wave feminism is often seen as beginning in the 1990s.
Women’s empowerment and promoting women’s rights have emerged as a part of a major global movement and is continuing to
      break new ground in recent years. Days like International Women’s Empowerment Day are also gaining momentum.

But despite a great deal of progress, women and girls continue to face discrimination and violence in every part of the world.<img

    <h3>Sports</h3>
    <p>Improves physical and mental health – One of the main benefits of sports and games is to boost the physical and mental
      health of a student. Sports is played between teams in a healthy competitive environment which ensures that the student remains active and fit. Outdoor sports like football, cricket, tennis, swimming, running, etc, keeps the body and mind active and engaged. Indoor games like chess, badminton, and table tennis enhance the concentration level of the student. It also strengthens the immunity system of the body and energizes them.

      Empower students with life skills – While sports not only help in developing physical and mental health, it also develop
      the life skills of a student’s personality. It enhances their capabilities and helps them to have a better understanding
      of themselves. Sports also help in developing social skills and getting along with people. They learn to interact not only with children of their age but also with adults like their coaches and seniors.
      Additionally, children acquire decision-making skills through various team activities.
Learn time management and discipline – Constructive use of time and discipline is a major characteristic of any sportsperson.
      If a student plays a sport, he/she needs to show the commitment of time to be in a particular place at a particular
      time everyday as a part of their routine. He/she must be patient, disciplined which will enable the student to cope with criticism and setbacks. Each sport has a set of rules and regulations to be followed which helps the students to stay fit and disciplined.

Improved leadership and team building qualities – Sports is all about teamwork. Jain Heritage School encourages team sports
      such as football, cricket, basketball etc. which gives an individual a sense of identity and belonging to a group.
      Such sports encourage children to showcase their talent and communicate with their team members. It also helps to
      identify and hone their leadership skills which add values to their personality.

Winning and losing is all part of the game – Sports is not always about winning. It is about fair play and believing in equality and justice. Losing is a part and parcel of any game and accepting defeat in a positive competitive spirit distinguishes a true sportsperson which propels him/her to strive harder the next time to achieve what he/she missed out on the previous game.

Boost self-confidence – Scoring a goal, hitting a six or winning a race not only makes a student happy but also it boosts their confidence. Performing in front of a crowd which is constantly noticing your each and every move can be quite unnerving. But a sportsperson is one with focus, patience, the right amount of confidence having a never-say-die attitude.<img

        <h3>Medical Research And Health</h3>
        <p>By performing a large-scale biobank-based genome-wide association study, we identified a strong link between
          the underlying risk of cardiometabolic disease and patterns of lifelong medication use in hyperlipidemia, hypertension and type 2 diabetes. We discover hundreds of genetic predictors of medication use behavior and show medication-use-enhanced applications for polygenic prediction in cardiometabolic diseases.<img
